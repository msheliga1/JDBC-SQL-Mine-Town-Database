# JDBC-SQL-Mining Town-Database
Sample JDBC Database of Mining Towns - Written Sept and Oct 2017 - Mike Sheliga
To demonstrate the creation of a database and use JDBC.
Be sure to run the "create" database executable. before running the query manager.
Once the database is setup and a simple query is working, the other SQL queries were relatively simple 
to get working.
One class to create the database.
A Manager class with 9 Queries.  Each query is invoked using a button.
As others note, there are really just 4 basic JDBC statements - get connection, get statement, query and update.
